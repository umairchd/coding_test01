# coding_test01

# IncreasingDecreasingNumbers

This is a Ruby class that provides methods for checking and counting increasing and decreasing numbers, as well as counting numbers up to a given power.

## Running the Tests

To run the tests for this class, you need to have the `rspec` gem installed. If you don't have it installed, you can install it by running the following command:


bundle install

Once you have `rspec` installed, you can run the tests using the following command:

rspec coding_test01_spec.rb


This command will execute the RSpec spec file `coding_test01_spec.rb` and display the test results in the console.

## Example Usage

You can also see an example usage of the `IncreasingDecreasingNumbers` class in the `coding_test01.rb` file. To run the example usage, simply execute the following command:

ruby coding_test01.rb

This will run the script and display the output in the console.

Feel free to modify the example usage file or create your own scripts to explore the functionality of the `IncreasingDecreasingNumbers` class.

Make sure to replace increasing_decreasing_numbers_spec.rb and example_usage.rb with the actual filenames of your spec file and example usage file, respectively.
